**The Power of Teamwork in Cybersecurity Hackathons 💪🔓**

☄ Cybersecurity hackathons highlight the power of teamwork and collaboration in tackling complex challenges. Recently, I had the privilege of participating in a Capture The Flag (CTF) hackathon hosted by **BLOOMBERG** and [**THE KNOWLEDGE HOUSE**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/theknowledgehouse_hackathonwinners-capturetheflag-cybersecurity-activity-7199144515373252609-4od5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
